# BirdCLEF 2022: CNN-BiLSTM Approach

Bird's voices classification using log filter banks converted into images and CNN-BiLSTM model.

## Description
In this task I decided to use following metrics to monitor the quality of fitting model: `accuracy`, `precision` and `recall`. Also, if you know `precision` and `recall`, it's simple to find `F1` metric.

Например, формула $$ a=b+c, $$ где \\( a=0 \\).

## Dataset
You can find all files for working with model and fitting the model on the page of the Kaggle competition "BirdCLEF 2022" ([here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/birdclef-2022/data))
